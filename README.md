### Hi there, I'm Paul! 👋

I'm a web & mobile developer. 

## 🔭 Current

I'm currently working with [Si2P](https://www.centre-formation-securite.fr/) - we're making an e-learning app. 

## ⚡️ Experience

I like to say that I'm full-stack, but I'm very experienced in the real-time backend world. I develop product with [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) or [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) to build an api, and I pair that with the frontend. I always tried new things like featured frameworks or new languages, like React or VueJS.
I've been working with Symfony for about 3 years, PHP for almost 4, and JavaScript for more than 5 years.
